Random person
-------------

The "random person" extension provides a collection of functions to generate random people, for use in word problems.

It doesn't really matter what people are called in word problems, but it can have a bad effect on students' perceptions of the world if the plumber's always called Gary and the nurse is always called Julie.
This extension makes it easy to randomly pick names, following the distribution of names and genders in the population of England and Wales.

For more information on how to use the extension, see `its documentation <https://github.com/numbas/numbas-extension-random-person>`__.
