How do I...
--------------------------

... include an image?
    At the moment, it's only possible to include images already hosted on a server somewhere else. 

... embed a video?
    Upload your video to somewhere like YouTube or Vimeo. Including videos in downloaded exam packages is a terrible idea, so we discourage that. Click the embed button (it's a blue cloud), and paste in the URL of your video.
