How do I...
--------------------------

... include an image?
    At the moment, it's only possible to include images already hosted on a server somewhere else. To embed an image, click on the :guilabel:`Insert/Edit Image` button (it's a small picture of a tree) and paste the URL of your image into the :guilabel:`Image URL` box.

... embed a video?
    Upload your video to somewhere like YouTube or Vimeo. Including videos in downloaded exam packages is a terrible idea, so we discourage that. Click the :guilabel:`Embed image/video` button (it's a blue cloud), and paste in the URL of your video.
