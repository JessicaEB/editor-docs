Gap-fill
^^^^^^^^

Gap-fill parts allow you to include answer inputs inline with the prompt text, instead of at the end of the part.

The :dfn:`gaps` are sub-parts. 
Include them in text by clicking on the :guilabel:`Insert gap` button on the toolbar, and entering the number of the gap you want to insert in the dialog box. 
You can double-click on a gap placeholder to change its number.

To insert a gap in the plain text editor, type the gap's number between two square brackets, e.g. `[[0]]` for the first gap.

The gap-fill part does not add any properties to the :data:`settings` object.
