How do I...
==============

... include an image?
-----------------------

    It's best practice to attach images to questions so that they're distributed with the final compiled exam, rather than linking to images stored on a webserver. 

    When editing a :ref:`content-area`, click on the :guilabel:`Insert/Edit Image` button. You can then either pick an image you've already uploaded, or click the :term:`Choose file` button to upload an image from your computer.

    You can resize images and add a title attribute by selecting the image in the :ref:`content-area` and clicking on the :guilabel:`Insert/Edit Image` button.

... embed a video?
------------------

    Upload your video to somewhere like YouTube or Vimeo. Including videos in downloaded exam packages is a terrible idea, so we discourage that. Click the :guilabel:`Embed image/video` button (it's a blue cloud), and paste in the URL of your video.
